# QuantM

QuantM by Solexa. 

We believe that quantum computing algorithms, parallel computing, and an integrated mobile & web application will increase diagnostic accuracy, decrease training time, improve ease of usage, and advance existing telemedicine technologies. QuantM aims to simplify existing approaches to telemedicine by providing an all-in-one utility for both healthcare providers and patients to monitor, track, and consult regarding the progression of an array of disease conditions.

Through the development of QuantM, we hope to solve existing problems not only in Telemedicine but the healthcare industry as a whole. Quantum Computing Algorithms(QCAs) and quantum hardware have a largely improved training time and accuracy rate compared to their classical counterparts.

The utilization of QCAs will revolutionize the entire healthcare artificial intelligence industry, along with telemedicine and diagnostic services in the near future. For example, existing industry standards on melanoma detection software and algorithms leave a 76% accuracy, which could be fatal when addressing one of the most deadly cancers inflicting mankind. In addition, as quantum machine learning requires a large amount of processing power, we utilize Parallel and Distributed Computing, which draws computing power from multiple computers to retain QCAâ€™s high accuracy in a significantly lesser amount of time. 

All of the above features are integrated into a website and mobile application. The website features video streaming to connect medical professionals with patients, help plan patient visits to nearby medical facilities, use standardized patient symptom forms, and the diagnosis software to help identify symptoms using the quantum algorithms. The mobile application can take photos of the disease affected areas, and allows patients to easily submit data, which are algorithmically interpreted and classified for the physician and doctors to make inferences. QuantM provides an all in one patient and healthcare provider platform where both parties can prevent, detect, and monitor the progression of an array of conditions with ease.
